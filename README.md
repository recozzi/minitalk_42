<h1>Minitalk</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
The Minitalk project involves developing a client-server communication system in the C programming language. Students are tasked with implementing a solution where a client can send messages to a server, employing advanced manipulation of system signals. Precise handling of signals, including the use of sigaction, is crucial to ensure reliable communication. The final result is an application that not only showcases students' proficiency in implementing distributed systems but also demonstrates their ability to handle critical aspects such as synchronization and error management.
